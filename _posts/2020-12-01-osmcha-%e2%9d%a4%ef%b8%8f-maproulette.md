OSMCha is a well known OSM changeset inspection and validation tool. It
lets you look at changesets through different lenses. You can filter by
individual mappers, geographic locations, mapping teams, and a variety
of flags that are automatically applied to changesets, like ‘possible
import’, ‘profanity’ and ‘outdated tags’. Using a combination of
filters, you can craft your very own feed of changesets that you would
like to review. In short, OSMCha is an indispensable tool for anyone
interested in what’s being added to OSM in fine detail.

Recently, OSMCha maintainer Wille Marcel added close integration between
OSMCha and MapRoulette. OSMCha can now create and maintain Challenges
based on incoming changesets that are automatically flagged by OSMCha.

Let’s look at an example.

One of many things OSMCha automatically flags is whenever a changeset
contains a change to a place node. Because place nodes represent the
name and location of a town, city, village or other settlement, edits to
these types of nodes should be fairly uncommon: the name or location of
a place usually does not change. It is reasonable for OSMCha to flag
these changesets for review by a human, just to make sure the change is
OK.

OSMCha creates the Challenge in MapRoulette (see
it [here](https://maproulette.org/browse/challenges/13658)) and will
continuously feed it with new tasks as it detects and flags changesets
containing modifications to a place node. Mappers then have an easy way
to quickly verify changes using the MapRoulette workflow—either at
random, or start with close to you and work your way through any other
nearby tasks.

The link between OSMCha and MapRoulette is a great example of how open
source OSM tools can connect and work together to bring the OSM
community the best possible tools to keep the map clean and fresh!
