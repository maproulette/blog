MapRoulette has had Leaderboards for a long time. You can access the
Global leaderboard for different periods of time right from the
MapRoulette homepage.

If you‚Äôre the owner of a Challenge, there‚Äôs also leaderboards in your
Challenge management dashboard. However, if you go there, you will find
that these are currently disabled. This is because we‚Äôre investigating
issues where the MapRoulette backend system would go into overdrive with
most Leaderboard queries, making MapRoulette very slow or even shut down
altogether for all users. This is of course unacceptable! We took
technical steps to remove some of the ‚Äúworst offenders‚Äù, so that is why
Challenge and Project Leaderboards are temporarily not available. Our
apologies!

The MapRoulette team started wondering how people actually use the
Leaderboards, so we can fix the system in a way that helps most users
without causing outages for everyone. Around 150 people responded, and
we would like to show you the outcomes.

Firstly, we asked how often you use the Leaderboards. About half of you
use them at least monthly, and around 33% never use them at all. We‚Äôre
happy to see that the Leaderboards are useful to a majority of
MapRoulette users!

We also asked to rank some specific Leaderboard features on a scale from
1 (unimportant) to 5 (essential). When asked about ‚ÄúSeeing the top
mappers overall‚Äù and ‚ÄúLeaderboards are updated live‚Äù, around 65% of
respondents found these functionalities at least somewhat important:

You rank the importance of ‚ÄúChoosing different time periods for the
Global Leaderboard‚Äù a little higher, with more of you considering this
an essential feature (26%) and 70% finding this at least somewhat
important:

Opinions on the other features were more skewed. Respondents skewed
towards higher importance on being able to see their own ranking and
having Project and Challenge level leaderboards, with more than 41% of
respondents ranking this as essential.

Seeing your own global ranking is also highly valued, with almost 80% of
respondents finding this at least somewhat important, and almost 35%
found it essential.

Thanks to your responses, we now have a really good sense of how popular
the Leaderboards are (very!) and that while none of the features we
asked about are unimportant to you, there are a couple that are more
highly valued. The most important one being the Project and Challenge
Leaderboards: we will make it a priority to bring those back!

Thanks for using MapRoulette and happy mapping!

*PS ‚Äì we also asked you to provide anonymous general feedback about
MapRoulette at the bottom of the questionnaire, and we got almost 50
responses on that question. It will take a little more time to work
through those, and we thank you for taking the time to write your
thoughts down.*
