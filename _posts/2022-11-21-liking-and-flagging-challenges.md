MapRoulette was designed to be an open, self-governing platform for OSM
improvement tasks. This has worked well, but from time to time, changes
are made in OSM based on MapRoulette tasks that were not clearly
formulated, or the assumptions behind the task are wrong. On the other
hand, we have Challenges in MapRoulette that are of exceptionally high
quality and make for an enjoyable, meaningful OSM editing experience.

As a way for the community to express both these sentiments, I would
like to introduce the option for mappers to flag and like Challenges. A
Flag means that you, as a mapper, have come across a questionable OSM
edit that was made based on a MapRoulette task that did not meet quality
standards. A Like on the other hand lets you show appreciation for the
hard work a Challenge creator has put into creating Tasks that are
meaningful and fun to work on.

I opened issues for both these new features:

- [Flag a Challenge](https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette3/issues/1868)
  on Github
- [Like a Challenge](https://github.com/osmlab/maproulette3/issues/1869)
  on Github

Let me know what you think about these ideas and share how you would
like to have them implemented on Github.
