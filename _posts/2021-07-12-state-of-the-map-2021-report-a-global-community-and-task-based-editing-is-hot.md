State of the Map, the OpenStreetMap conference, just wrapped up
yesterday in its second online year. It was, as always, an exciting
opportunity for the community and data users to connect and exchange
ideas and new developments from the OpenStreetMap world.

If I had to point out one single highlight, it would have to be the
representation of OSM community members from around the globe. I met
people from The Philippines to Brazil and from Kenya to Russia. The
online format is an equalizer, whether you have the means and time to
travel or not, if you can connect to the internet, you could be there.
Registration was free as well.

Plenty of interesting developments are happening in the ‚ÄúTask‚Äù space
that MapRoulette also occupies. I was really excited to learn more about
[MapComplete](https://mapcomplete.osm.be/), an application that lets you
create thematic OSM maps that anyone can contribute to with a few
clicks. MapComplete creator Pieter Vander Vennet [presented the latest
developments](https://2021.stateofthemap.org/sessions/3E98CC/) and
[hosted a workshop](https://2021.stateofthemap.org/sessions/WD8BGF/)
about creating your own themes from a hospital bed! (He broke his hip
in, I think, a skateboarding accident and is doing well.) MapComplete
has seen a lot of interest not just from OSM Mappers, but also
governments and other organizations who are interested in improving
specific POI layers in OSM.

[StreetComplete](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete) is
another fantastic task-based OSM application. It is an Android app that
lets you improve and add OSM data when out in the field. It makes
optimal use of the ‚ÄòEyes on the Ground‚Äô, so it is a perfect complement
to ‚ÄòArmchair‚Äô tools like MapComplete and MapRoulette. StreetComplete has
improved tremendously in the past year, helped by funding from NLNet and
the OSMF [Microgrant
program](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Microgrants/Microgrants_2020/Proposal/Map_Maintenance_with_StreetComplete).
StreetComplete creator Tobias Zwick
[presented](https://2021.stateofthemap.org/sessions/7M7WVX/) on how
StreetComplete handles edits. Sadly his talk happened at the same time
as the MapRoulette workshop I‚Äôll talk about in just a minute, but once
all talk recordings are published I will catch up.

StreetComplete also came up in a Birds of a Feather session hosted by
Ilya Zverev ([notes](https://hackmd.io/APIwK16rTUWlMNnDlh_ZEQ?view))
that focused on mobile editors for non-experts. I was there for part of
it, and among other things there was a really interesting discussion
about the merits of taking photos to help improve OSM. I have been
thinking about adding a ‚ÄúPhoto‚Äù Challenge type to MapRoulette that would
create tasks from user-submitted photos. This could either be to
classify photos (is it of opening hours? A storefront? A road?) or to
actually edit the map based on the photo‚Äôs content.

I was happy to see MapRoulette mentioned in quite a few talks. For
example in the [update Laura Mugeha gave
us](https://2021.stateofthemap.org/sessions/L9XART/) about growing the
community in Kenya. MapRoulette appears in the training materials she
and the Kenya community developed to educate new mappers. This inspired
me to submit a talk or workshop about MapRoulette for [State of the Map
Africa](https://2021.stateofthemap.africa/), which will also be online
and held later this year. Fortunately the call for submissions is still
open until July 20.

Finally, I [hosted a
workshop](https://2021.stateofthemap.org/sessions/Z3U8JX/) session about
creating [cooperative and tag-fix
Challenges](https://learn.maproulette.org/documentation/creating-cooperative-challenges/#content)
for MapRoulette. It was not recorded by the organization (none of the
workshops were as far as I know) but I recorded it myself üôÇ and have
already published it on YouTube. It is almost an hour long but really
worth it if you want to get into creating these special types of
MapRoulette Challenges that can help tremendously with ‚ÄúManual Import‚Äù
organized activities in OSM.

I received some really positive feedback on the workshop and I can‚Äôt
wait to see new Cooperative and Tag-Fix Challenges the community comes
up with!

To conclude, I had a fantastic time overall connecting and reconnecting
with other mappers and learning so much about this topic but also so
many other things that are going on in the community! I hope next year
we can all connect in person again.
