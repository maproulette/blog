MapRoulette hosts monthly Community Meetings that are open to anyone
interested!

The Community Meetings are on the first Tuesday of every month, at [1pm
Mountain
Time](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=1pm+Mountain+Time&atb=v423-1&ia=web). We
post the meetings [on OSMCal](https://osmcal.org/) as well.

I usually start by giving you an update of the latest features and
fixes. After that, the floor is yours to ask questions, make suggestions
or tell everyone how you use MapRoulette. We really like talking to our
users, so please join us. The meeting happens on the OSM Foundationâ€™s
video meeting platform, [here is the link to the
room](https://osmvideo.cloud68.co/user/mar-qgi-crm-yxn).

Just as a reminder, MapRoulette is also on Mastodon:
<https://en.osm.town/@MapRoulette>.

I hope to talk to you soon.
