MapRoulette is designed to let you map wherever the tasks are. This
means that, depending on the Challenge, you can be mapping in Indonesia
one minute, and in South Africa the next. We think this is part of what
makes MapRoulette fun!

But sometimes, you may want to just stay in a specific area. MapRoulette
lets you do that, too! In this blog post, we show you two different
techniques: Nearby Tasks and Virtual Challenges.

### Nearby Tasks

After you complete a task, a dialog appears that lets you leave a
comment for the Challenge author, add MapRoulette Tags, and mark the
task for Review. At the very bottom, you can also select where you want
your next task to be: Random (the default) or Nearby:

When you select Nearby, a helpful map appears that lets you see where
tasks exist within the same Challenge. If you see none, you can zoom out
until you find Nearby tasks. You can then manually select the Task you
want to work on next, or click Submit as usual and MapRoulette will find
a Nearby Task for you.

### Virtual Challenges

Another great way to work on Tasks in a small area is to create a
Virtual Challenge. This is a little known but powerful feature of
MapRoulette! A Virtual Challenge is a collection of Tasks you created on
the fly in the Find Challenges screen. To create one, apply the Filters
you want, then draw a lasso on the map to define the area you want Tasks
for, and select ‘Work on X Tasks’.

MapRoulette will then take all the Tasks that fall inside the lasso you
drew, and create an instant Virtual Challenge with its own link you can
share. Great for just you or for a local mapping meetup!
