Did you know that MapRoulette has extensive documentation? Up until now,
the documentation was only available in English. With a recent update,
you can now help translate the documentation in your own language!

We
use the Transifex platform to make it easy for anyone to help translate.
The instructions are, where else, [on the MapRoulette Documentation
website](https://learn.maproulette.org/en-us/documentation/translate-docs/)!
By the way, did you know that MapRoulette itself is already available in
18 languages? The incredible work to make this happen was done by a
dedicated community of more than 100 translators. Not all languages are
complete and some requested ones are still missing! If you want to help,
head over [to
Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/osmlab/maproulette3/) to get
started. Thanks translator community!
