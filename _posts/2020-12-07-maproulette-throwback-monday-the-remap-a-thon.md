Did you know that MapRoulette started out as The OpenStreetMap US
Remap-A-Thon?

There was only one Challenge: to repair the road network in the United
States after OpenStreetMap changed its data license from Creative
Commons to the Open Database License. Mapping data from contributors who
did not agree to this change, or could not be contacted, had to be
deleted or reverted. This caused a large number of gaps in the road
network. Some particularly bad examples:

With more than 70,000 such gaps and other errors, and a U.S. mapping
community that was still very small, it felt like an almost
insurmountable challenge to fix everything. That is when I came up with
the basic idea for what was to become MapRoulette: what if we break this
big problem up into very small tasks that almost anyone can fix quickly?

After a weekend of programming, the Remap-A-Thon was ready, and after
[announcing](http://gis.19327.n8.nabble.com/Announcing-Remap-a-tron-tt5723114.html#none)
it on the talk-us mailing list, it quickly became a popular way to help
fix the road network in the U.S.

The community fixed all gaps in the road network in 4 weeks with the
help of the Remap-A-Thon tool! After this initial success, development
continued as I started to add more features like multiple Challenges,
leaderboards, OSM login, and more. Most importantly, MapRoulette became
a global community product, with many contributors around the world
helping make MapRoulette better. Thank you!
