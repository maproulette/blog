If you’re reading this, chances are that you are excited about the
upcoming State of the Map conference in Firenze, Italy! Whether you are
attending in person or virtually, lots to look forward to. I will be
presenting on “10 years of MapRoulette” on the first day of the
conference. The presentation is coming together nicely and will feature
a retrospective, but I will also be examining the current state of
MapRoulette, and suggesting some paths for future development. These
will be just that: suggestions. I am really interested in hearing from
you, MapRoulette users and developers. What do you want to happen with
MapRoulette? What place should it aim to take in the ever growing family
of OSM editing and quality analysis tools out there?

Here are a couple of drafts for the the forward-looking slides I plan to
present:

Let me know what your ideas are, please! If you will be in Firenze,
please come to the presentation on Friday morning, right after the
opening proceedings, or catch me anytime after for a chat. If there’s
room and time, I will try to organize an informal session where we can
discuss MapRoulette plans and ideas. Please keep an eye on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/maproulette) for updates.
