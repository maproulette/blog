“[Water Geometry in Fairfield County
(Connecticut)](https://maproulette.org/browse/challenges/14274)” is a
challenge created by roptat, who resides in Connecticut, USA.

Anyone can participate in this challenge as it requires only aerial
imagery. The challenge’s goal is to improve the geometry of water
features such as lakes and rivers that often cross other objects such as
roads and buildings. Roptat and other contributors originally decided to
look for building data to import. They found multiple data sources, but
only one in Fairfield County had good size and shape accuracy. After
going through that building dataset, they noticed that roads and water
features were imported previously from a low-resolution dataset. Because
of that, they found that the existing water geometry needs to be
adjusted too.

It’s a fun and straightforward project that anyone can contribute to,
and a great way to learn how to map water and help a local community!  
Happy mapping!
